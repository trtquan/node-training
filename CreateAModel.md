First of all we need a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection. It defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Schemas are building block for Models. They can be nested to create complex models, but in this case weâ€™ll keep things simple. A model allows you to create instances of your objects, called documents.

Defining your schema
Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.
```js
  import mongoose from 'mongoose';
  const { Schema } = mongoose;

  const blogSchema = new Schema({
    title:  String, // String is shorthand for {type: String}
    author: String,
    body:   String,
    comments: [{ body: String, date: Date }],
    date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
    hidden: Boolean,
    meta: {
      votes: Number,
      favs:  Number
    }
  });
  
  ```
